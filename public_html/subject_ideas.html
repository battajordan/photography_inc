			The greatest subjects and places to take pictures are the ones that you are already passionate about. But it can be hard to come up with your own ideas to start out with. Some basic ideas include:
        </p>
			<ul>
				<li> Holiday Pictures 
				    <ul>
				        <li> Halloween </li>
				        <li> Family Get-togethers </li>
				        <li> Winter </li>
				    </ul>
				</li>
				<li> Animals - pets are a great starting point </li>
				<li> Nature - a nearby park, river, or woodland areas work well </li>
				<li> Children - kids are almost always doing something funny. Even if the picture doesn't turn out well, you'll still have a story to tell! </li>
				<li> Sporting events</li>
				<li> Fairs - county fairs, state fairs, renaissance fairs, whatever interests you!</li>
			</ul>
