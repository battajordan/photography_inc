[CSE] Message number 1 in line 5:5:
When a foreground color is defined, consider also defining a
background color (by using the "background" or
"background-color" property). This helps to avoid conflict
with user-defined style sheets and to improve accessibility.

[CSE] Message number 2 in line 7:18:
Typefaces from more than one family were given. Typically,
for a consistent look, the typefaces should all be from the
same font family. Number of serif family typefaces: 1
("serif"), sans-serif: 0, cursive: 0, fantasy: 0, monospace:
0, other: 1 ("algerian"). Typefaces classified as "other" do
not belong in any one of the other families. This could be
because using the typeface could result in different
typefaces from different families being used, depending on
what's on the user's system. Consider using a more specific
typeface to avoid this issue (like "lucida sans" instead of
"lucida").

The following typeface may not be available on a significant
number of browsers: "algerian". If the typeface(s) are being

[CSE] Warning number 1 in line 39:10:
Many mobile devices use touch screens making ":hover"
problematic, cumbersome, or impossible to use. Depending on
the browser, ":hover" might never match, or it might match
for brief moments, or until the user touches another
element. Ensure that content is never only accessible or
only visible by hovering. This message is displayed only
once.

Cannot find the declaration block for this selector or

"h1 {color: red;}". "h1" is the selector and "{color: red;}"
is the declaration block.

[CSE] Error number 3 in line 44:10:
Missing pseudo-class or pseudo-element after the colon.
NOTE: New CSS3 pseudo-elements must use the CSS3 two colon
syntax (such as ::first-line) that is different from the one
colon syntax for pseudo-classes.

[CSE] Comment number 1:
Beginner mode is on. This mode may reduce the number of
validator messages and make other changes to make this
program easier to use, but less powerful. To toggle this
mode, please choose 'Options->Beginner Mode' in the editor.
See the getting started documentation (Help->Getting
Started) for more information.

[CSE] Comment number 2:
[73] Section 508 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 3:
[73] WCAG 1.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 4:
[73] WCAG 2.0 accessibility checking is off.

[CSE] Comment number 5:
Accessibility checking is off. This program can help you
make your web pages more accessible. An accessible page is
one that more individuals can use, such as individuals who
are blind or deaf. It can also increase the usefulness of
your web page for individuals who browse the web using
slower devices like older computers or wireless devices like
mobile phones and PDAs. An accessible web site makes good
business sense (and possibly good legal sense as well) and
may even improve search engine rankings. You can enable or
disable accessibility checking in the Validator Engine
Options.

[CSE] Comment number 6:
