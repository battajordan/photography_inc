        <p>
           We're two college students trying to help others learn the art of photography. We gained our skills at Simpson College and through many study abroad
            experiences. We have taken an interest in creating this website because we believe that everyone should know the joys of owning their very own camera. We             fell in love with photography while we were in Intro to Photography in high school. It made us really appreciate how a memory can be cherished on a piece             of paper for years to come, like our graduation day from high school.
